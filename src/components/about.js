				<h1>My Life</h1>
				<p>I'm a sophomore CS Student at UCSB, graduating in 2022. I have plans to participate in the 5 year BS/MS Program to graduate with an MS in Computer Science in 23. After that, I don't really know what I want to do. There are so many options out there and I'd like to metaphorically shop around before I choose what I want to specialize in.</p>
